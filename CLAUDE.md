# Al Khazna - Clean Project State

## Overview
Al Khazna is a simple, elegant app for tracking monthly income and expenses with modern UI design.

## Completed Features

### ✅ **Home Screen Redesign**
Successfully implemented home screen styling with:
- App title "Alkhazna" at top
- Select Period section with Month/Year dropdowns (48px height, grey background)
- Blue "Month Details" button
- Green gradient "Total Balance" card with number formatting
- Mobile-responsive layout with proper spacing and shadows

### ✅ **Income/Outcome Screens with Reusable Components**
- **Reusable IncomeRow Widget** (`lib/widgets/income_row.dart`):
  * Single solid light blue background with rounded corners
  * Alternating row colors (lighter/darker blue based on row index)
  * Three fields: Amount (numeric, 4-char limit), Name (string), Index (row number)
  * TextFields styled to look like plain text labels by default
  * Background matches row color, transparent borders when unfocused
  * Green border appears around individual field when focused/tapped
  * Index column is read-only text aligned to the right
  * Amount text appears in green if value > 0, otherwise black
- **Enhanced UX**: Clean data table appearance with on-demand editing
- **State Management**: Proper callback handling for data updates
- Maintained all functionality (swipe actions, auto-save, etc.)

### ✅ **Enhanced Expense Screen**
Redesigned expense screen with:
- Modern UI form-based input matching design specifications
- Date picker section with calendar icon and proper formatting
- Description and Amount input fields with grey backgrounds and rounded corners
- Red "Add Expense" button (50px height) with proper styling and icon
- Card-based expense list with rounded corners
- Amount displayed in red with number formatting (commas)
- Description text in center (supports Arabic text)
- Date in DD/MM format
- Row number in red circle on the right
- Swipe-to-delete with confirmation dialog
- Form validation ensuring both description and amount are filled

### ✅ **Storage & Data Management**
- **Clean Data Loading**: Returns only actual data, no auto-generation
- **User-Controlled**: Users manually add entries using + buttons
- **Empty State Handling**: Both screens handle zero entries gracefully
- **Reliable Deletion**: Can delete all entries including the final one
- **Navigation Stability**: Fixed phantom entries reappearing after screen switches

### ✅ **Android Compatibility**
- Fixed Android back navigation warning
- Added `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` to AndroidManifest.xml
- Enabled Android's predictive back gesture system (Android 13+)
