# PRD: Share Zero Names Feature

## Product Requirements Document
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 13, 2025
**Product:** Al Khazna - Income & Expense Tracker
**Feature:** Share Zero Amount Names as PDF

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a simple, focused enhancement to Al Khazna: a one-tap button to export and share names of income entries with zero amounts as a clean PDF. This feature addresses the practical need to quickly identify and share income sources that require attention.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Point
Users cannot easily identify or share which income sources have zero amounts and need follow-up. There's no simple way to extract and share this information for:
- Personal tracking and reminders
- Sharing with financial advisors
- Following up on missing income sources
- Creating action items for income optimization

### User Impact
- Manual identification of zero-amount entries is time-consuming
- No way to quickly share lists for collaboration or advice
- Difficulty in tracking which income sources need attention

---

## Solution

### Simple "Share Zero Names" Feature

**Core Concept:** One button that instantly creates and shares a PDF containing only the names of income entries with zero amounts.

**Key Principles:**
- **Simplicity**: One button, no configuration
- **Speed**: Under 1 second generation
- **Clean**: Only names, minimal formatting
- **Practical**: Direct sharing capability

---

## User Story

### Primary User Story
**As a user**, I want to quickly share the names of income sources with zero amounts so that I can easily follow up on missing income or share with others for advice.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single "Share Zero Names" button on income screen
- [ ] One-tap operation with no complex dialogs or options
- [ ] PDF contains only names (no amounts) of entries where amount = 0

- **UI-9**: Hidden state: Not visible when no zero entries exist
- **UI-10**: Loading state: Disabled with spinner during generation
- **UI-11**: Error state: Brief error indication if generation fails

---

## PDF Format Specification

### Layout Requirements
- **PDF-1**: Header with app name "Al Khazna"
- **PDF-2**: Title: "Income Sources - Zero Amounts"
- **PDF-3**: Simple bulleted or numbered list of names

### Content Requirements
- **PDF-6**: Include only names of entries where amount = 0
- **PDF-7**: No amounts, totals, or complex formatting
- **PDF-8**: Handle empty list case with appropriate message
- **PDF-9**: Maintain name order as displayed in app

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Development (3-4 days)
**Priority:** High

#### Day 1: Data Logic
- Implement logic to identify zero-amount entries
- Create function to extract names from zero-amount entries
- Handle edge cases (no data, all zero, no zero entries)

#### Day 2: PDF Generation
- Extend existing PDF service for simple name lists
- Implement minimal formatting for clean list output
- Add Arabic text support verification

#### Day 3: UI Integration
- Add "Share Zero Names" button to income screen
- Implement button visibility logic
- Integrate with PDF generation and sharing

#### Day 4: Testing & Polish
- Test button behavior and PDF output
- Verify sharing functionality across devices
- Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 2: Refinement (1-2 days)
**Priority:** Medium

#### Day 5: UI Polish
- Perfect button placement and styling
- Optimize loading states and feedback
- Final visual adjustments

#### Day 6: Edge Case Testing
- Test with large datasets
- Verify Arabic text handling
- Test error scenarios and recovery

## Edge Cases and Handling

### Data Scenarios
1. **No income entries exist**
   - Button: Hidden
   - Behavior: Feature not available

2. **No zero-amount entries exist**
   - Button: Hidden
   - Behavior: Feature not needed

3. **All entries have zero amounts**
   - Button: Visible and functional
   - PDF: Contains all entry names

4. **Mixed data with some zero amounts**
   - Button: Visible and functional
   - PDF: Contains only zero-amount entry names

### Technical Scenarios
1. **PDF generation fails**
   - Show error message to user
   - Log error for debugging
   - Allow user to retry

2. **Sharing dialog cancelled**
   - Clean up temporary PDF file
   - Return to normal state
   - No error message needed

3. **Large dataset performance**
   - Optimize for up to 1000 entries
   - Show progress if needed
   - Implement timeout handling
